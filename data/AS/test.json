based on moments is applied to the problem of expressing the vertical variability of any selected rock type or characteristic of the stratigraphic unit  by means of a continuous function that can be contoured. it is also possible to show whether the rock type or zone of interest is concentrated within the stratigraphic unit at  position, or whether it is widely distributed through the unit. the method is illustrated by a study of sandstones in part of the cretaceous of north-central wyoming. the vertical variability maps show that for the interval studied  the center of gravity of the sands is about a third of the way down the section in the southwest map area, and descends lower in the section toward the powder river basin. the vertical range of the sands also increases toward the basin, but in a less regular manner."},{"MAG_ID":2938628769,"tags":"Q2991667","hr_tags":"multilayer perceptron","label":10,"problem":"the detection of the target depends on the accuracy of the

science including inductive learning , language acquisition , and vision . while these bayesian ideas provide computation level models, it is beneficial, and sometimes necessary, to appeal to some implementation-level  models to explain human behaviour. connectionist approaches provide a neural-based model of cognitive processes. there is growing evidence in neuroscience supporting the relevance of bayesian models on a neural level . many perceptual and sensorimotor tasks that are learned and performed by the central nervous system can be described in a bayesian framework . neural computations, as simple as summing up the firing rates, can be seen as analogous to a bayesian inference process, with population activity patterns encoding posterior distributions . in theoretical terms, connectionist models show promising prospects in implementing computational-level bayesian ideas. under certain assumptions, and inspired by the nature of neural activation functions, neural units can compute posterior probability values . so-called , a type of stochastic , were also suggested to implement bayesian learning . later work introduced generative networks called restrictive

acquisitions to gain access to new technologies and technical capabilities. technology acquisitions are defined as the acquisition of young technology-based firms made by large established firms to graft the acquired technological capabilities onto their own resource bases . the advantages of taking over such young technology-based firms are clear from the perspective of the acquirer. first, they provide fast access to valuable assets such as technologies and innovative capabilities . second, young technology-based firms have organizational advantages in terms of innovation and exploration, which explains their attractiveness for incumbents . moreover, technology acquisitions offer fast access to new markets, while internal development is a more risky strategy to enter new markets. technology acquisitions are not only an important strategic objective from the perspective of the acquirer, also for the young technology-based firm it might be interesting to pursue an acquisition strategy as it offers them access to the complementary assets necessary to bring their products to the market . besides, technology acquisitions constitute an essential exit route for the venture capitalist investing in the firm. nowadays, the majority of the financial returns realized by venture capitalists are generated by acquisitions . the objective of this doctoral study is to investigate how the three parties mentioned above can contribute to the success of the acquisition, taking in account that the definition of success might differ depending on the party under study. while the acquirer is primarily interested in performance after acquisition, the young technology-based firm and the venture capitalist are rather interested the acquisition as such and the return generated by this event. this dissertation consists of three studies, each zooming in on one of those parties involved. the first paper of this dissertation studies the acquisition from the perspective of the acquirer. more specifically, it investigates how certain strategic decision taken by the acquirer influence acquisition performance. using a case study design, this study unravels how the strategic decisions and actions undertaken by the acquirer in the pre- and postacquisition stage are interrelated and how they affect acquisition performance. the empirical findings clearly demonstrate how preacquisition and postacquisition are closely correlated and influence one another. the interviews further revealed that both search and selection are crucial in preparing the implementation of the acquisition, as they moderate some of the typical selection problems  and implementation problems . with respect to search, our findings confirm that it is crucial to develop effective search strategies which allow the acquirer to identify interesting acquisition target. the search for suitable acquisition targets usually occurs by means of engaging in collaboration agreements, corporate venture capital, licensing agreements etc. they allow the acquirer to gain in-depth knowledge about the potential acquisition target before the actual acquisition. this knowledge helps the acquirer to better manage both the selection stage and the postacquisition implementation stage. regarding selection, we explored how decisions taken during the selection and due diligence process influence the subsequent stages of the acquisition. the empirical data indicate that involvement of the client department is a crucial success factor in the acquisition process for the following reasons. first, the client department is best suited to check a number of assumptions with respect to the expected synergies. second, the involvement of client department during the pre-acquisition stages also secures buy-in and commitment from this department to acquisition, thereby reducing the resistance of the employees to the acquisition and facilitating implementation. finally, we discovered that the interrelatedness of these process components has implications for the team that is managing the acquisition. in particular, the interviews revealed that acquisitions might benefit from project management, where one dedicated team is responsible for the management of the file. in a second paper, attention shifted from the acquirer to the young technology-based firm. this study aims to investigate how the strategic actions of the young technology-based firm contribute to the chance of being acquired and the acquisition return. building on resource-based theory, a number of hypotheses were developed to predict the impact of technical, human and social resources on acquisition likelihood on the one hand and the impact of revenue generating capabilities on acquisition return on the other. based upon an analysis of  young technology-based firms, it appears that hiring managers with experience in the sector and patenting both have a positive influence on the likelihood of being acquired. regarding acquisition return, both revenues and commercial and research partnerships have a positive impact on acquisition return. conversely, hiring experienced top manager and patents seem to negatively affect acquisition return. the third study finally, intends to examine to what extend the experience of the venture capital firm investing in the young technology-based company influences the likelihood of realizing an acquisition. for the development of the hypotheses, organizational learning theory was used. this theory distinguishes between three types of learning: learning from own experiences, learning from the experiences of others and congenital experience . the analysis of  british young technology-based firms reveals that both experiential learning from own trade sale experience and vicarious learning from the trade sale experiences of the syndicate partners have a significant positive impact on the likelihood of realizing a trade sale. congenital experience on the other hand has no significant impact. these three studies make a number of significant contributions to the literature. the first paper primarily contributes to the literature on technology acquisitions."},{"MAG_ID":2786808496,"tags":"Q17084460","hr_tags":"convolutional neural-network","label":5,"problem":"it is necessary to develop an automated insect

fusion and its board for this acknowledgement of work carried out at the mit alcator c-mod tokamak. i must begin by making it clear that this is in no way an award to an individual. the experiments, data analysis and paper were a true collaborative effort from the c-mod team. it is a honor to work with them and to accept the award on their behalf. i would also like to thank the us department of energy for their support in funding this research. the paper describes the exploration of the 'improved' confinement regime dubbed 'i-mode'. the distinguishing feature of this operational mode is a robust boundary pedestal in temperature with the somewhat surprising lack of any form of density pedestal. thus the regime exhibits an enhanced energy confinement similar to h-mode, roughly double of l-mode at fixed input power, yet has global fuel and impurity particle transport of l-mode. these features are intriguing from a scientific and practical point of view. on the science side it is extremely useful to obtain such a clear demarcation between the energy and particle transport. for example, soon after its discovery, the i-mode was used to extract the observation that the edge t pedestal is the strongest determinant for intrinsic rotation in work by john rice, pat diamond and colleagues. recent results regarding core transport by anne white, nate howard and colleagues show that i-mode has intriguing properties with respect to core response of fluctuations and profile stiffness. mike churchill's recent ph. d study on c-mod shows that i-mode exhibits no strong poloidal impurity asymmetry, unlike h-mode. the i-mode posed an interesting test for the peeling-ballooning-kbm model of the pedestal, the subject of the  nuclear fusion award of phil snyder, and was examined by john walk and jerry hughes showing that in fact the lack of the density pedestal pushed the i-mode far away from the p-b limit, and thus the limiting transport\/stability feature of the i-mode was in a sense self-enforcing for keeping the regime free of . also intriguing is that the i-mode exhibits global energy confinement scaling with a very weak power degradation, presumably this arises from a temperature pedestal which is not regulated by stability, it seems i-mode provides fertile ground for studying basic plasma phenomena. from a pragmatic point of view i-mode has now been obtained and studied in asdex-upgrade and diii-d, as reported by amanda hubbard at this conference. there are interesting similarities to the c-mod observations, such as a te pedestal without a density pedestal, but also differences which are being sorted through in details of the edge fluctuations and the operational window to access i-mode. the i-mode is 'found' at power levels between l- and h, and thus suppressing the h-mode transition is a key aspect to maintaining i-mode. this is done basically by operating with the ion grad-b drift pointed away from the primary x-point. this is one of the reasons why intrinsically stationary regimes like i-mode, and others like qh-mode, are an attractive option for burning plasma scenarios without the need for , if accessible and maintainable this requires no additional hardware since the pedestal self-regulates. in addition i-mode is highly attractive because of the l-mode particle confinement: the turbulence-dominated particle transport greatly eases both fuelling requirements and impurity control. indeed i-mode is highly successful on the all high-z wall of c-mod. and in a burning plasma the control of the operating point is primarily through density control, thus one foresees that burn control through densification is very powerful and promising. recent work has suggested that the power requirement to access i-mode has rather weak b dependence. this may explain why the regime has a relatively wide operating window in the high-field c-mod and i-mode may be highly applicable to high b iter and reactors."},{"MAG_ID":3033694261,"tags":"Q17084460","hr_tags":"convolutional neural-network","label":5,"problem":"recently, many  based models obtain remarkable performance in single-image

of human operators. model-based diagnosis is a commonly used approach to identify anomalies and root causes within a system through the use of models, which are often times manually created by experts. however, manual modelling takes a lot of effort and is not suitable for today's fast-changing systems. today, the large amount of sensor data provided by modern plants enables data-driven solutions and models can be learned from data, significantly reducing the manual modelling efforts. these data-driven solutions enable tasks such as condition monitoring: anomalies can be detected automatically, giving operators the chance to restore the plant to a working state before production losses occur. the choice of the model depends on a couple of factors, one of which is the type of the available signals. hybrid timed automata are one type of model which separate the systems behaviour into different modes, e.g. valve open or motor is running through discrete events which are for example created from binary signals of the plant or through real-valued signal thresholds, defined by experts. the real-valued signals are then separated into the corresponding modes to improve the anomaly detection process in comparison to unseparated data. the anomaly detection for hybrid timed automata combines the detection of timing errors and sequence errors in the mode changes and the

metamorphosis  any type of object found in the galaxy comprised of rocks\/minerals\/solid iron\/nickel is immediately considered to be very, very old material. the firm reasoning is in basic geology. it takes considerable amounts of time, pressure and heat to form rocks and minerals, or even the thompson structures found in meteorites. saying rocks just clump together in outer space neglects basic geology...what process formed the rocks absent pressure and heat in the vacuum to begin with? let us not get ahead of ourselves here. to astronomers rocky, gaseous and plasmatic material in large quantites which comprise stars and their older remains are all very close in age. not only that, but if the objects orbit eachother then they are all the same age. when a beetle is orbiting your head, does it make it the same age as you? why do we look at earth and assume its the same age as the sun, just because it is in a similar locale, galactically speaking? in sm, hot bright plasmatic objects are young, gaseous ones are middle aged, and rocky\/solid metal objects are very old. radiometrically dating the meteorites that we have found on the ground, and even the ground itself shows this. any other reasoning would be in denial of basic physical philosophy. set a rock next to a blazing campfire, note which one lasts longer. it is not much of a thought experiment if you will, but it certainly applies in this case. even if the sun were nuclear powered as claimed, the rocks of the earth will still last much, much longer. two ancient dead earths orbit the sun, they are called mercury, venus and mars. the light curve did suggest that j was a young, rapidly spinning star, but it also held other, more intriguing information. whether or not a star is rapidly spinning is irrelevant to determine its age. if a star is young, it has a light curve in sm. old stars  do not have light curves, they are comprised of rocks and minerals and are differentiated with iron\/nickel cores. so put in perspective, the fact that it has a light curve suggests that is it a young star, as it is still hot and vibrant as opposed to much older stars which are stable, have solid surfaces with water, and are generally life friendly such as earth. dead stars do not have light curves or strong global magnetic fields, such as venus and mercury, but that is for later. further studies of this unique system promise to reveal new, unprecedented details of how planets and moons form around other stars. approaching the issue inside of a false paradigm will not yield answers. you have to change the way you view the problem and question the assumptions. the theory you use will determine what you can see. using false theory means you will not see very much. if we were right, the gargantuan planetary rings would be the first found outside of our own solar system. not so fast. astronomers have already found gargantuan planetary rings, they are called protoplanetary disks. which begs the question, when does a planetary ring stop being planetary and become a protoplanetary disk? are they not the same things? again, this mirrors the issue. stars are young planets they are both termed astrons. a protoplanetary disk is nothing but a debris disk, which is also nothing but a planetary ring. some are bigger than others, most dissipate as the material falls out of orbit, some are recent and glow in the infrared, some do not. they all signal destruction, which goes back to the claim of a new born moon. it is more than likely the remains of an impact event which lost its material and formed the ring to begin with, a giant shrapnel field of an object which was partly destroyed if anything, far from being a newborn moon. they are observing a violent, nasty collision crime scene of a pre-existing object slamming into another pre-existing object. of course, this is never mentioned in the article, destruction is not quite understood in astronomy though it is claimed to be. the author was in artillery in the marines, and knows that when things collide with explosive inertia, they do not make bigger objects, they make smaller ones. again, physical philosophy is paramount, but ignored. it is suggested that astronomers seek out marines so they can relay the explosive events and what they do to matter. experience with these events can give astronomers a much richer understanding of nature than staring at math equations and solving for x. given its estimated ageonly  million yearsany gas-giant planet around it would still be glowing brightly in infrared light from the heat of its formation. the gas giant could be glowing in infrared light from the heat of its formation, and if it is, this is correct and has no problem fitting in with sm if you fit its formation as starting out as a much bigger, hotter, brighter star. the bright star in the center is probably only  million years old, sure as well has no issues inside of sm. but the gas giant orbiting it is actually much older than its orbiting host, they are definitely not the same age. it is a much older brown dwarf if it is glowing in infrared light clearly, which was adopted by its host... again, its new adoption probably caused it to swing a pre-existing object out of its orbit to then smash against another pre-existing object forming the shrapnel field called planetary disk which is so massive. consistency in theory is paramount and available if astronomers wish to see siberian tigers in their natural environment. it is thought that saturn once had larger rings, but the small particles at the system's outer edges clumped together through their mutual gravity in a runaway process that formed some of the saturian moons familiar to us now. this vista would have been as beautiful as it was fleetingany observer would have been lucky to live in just the right slice of cosmic time to see it. rings forming into giant spherical moons? this rings that all too familiar bell, how exactly did the rings lose their angular momentum? glossing over the same problem as the protoplanetary disk theory again. ignore, ignore, ignore. plus they make formation of a moon as a fleeting process? this is poor physical philosophy. it takes millions of years for a mountain to form, how does an object many millions of times larger just clump from tiny dust grains and rocks with gravity alone in a fleeting process? this reeks of creationism, and has a backdrop of catastrophism. forming an object as large as a saturian moon does not happen in a fleeting moment, destroying something that is larger than it, yes, but clumping dust and pebbles together in a supposed runaway process and  there you have it? where do we insert the free miracle? do the rocks form absent their chemistry of formation or they clump together absent losing their angular momentum? wreathed with fans of debris produced by collisions, the ring plane would be awash with undulating waves of clumping material. in sm the rings were formed from a collision event, they are not going to form back into the object that was destroyed creating them. astronomers can destroy and create at the same time using the same physical mechanism apparently, like an artillery round exploding and then reassembling back into a smooth bullet shaped shell, with gravity alone mind you! proving the existence of moons around extrasolar gas giants would greatly expand the possibilities for places where life could exist. this is easy for sm to explain. they have already been found. a star is a young gas giant, and they have been found with exoplanets, which are going to lose their mass to photoevaporation and collision events  becoming what are called exo-moons. they are already proven if you will, it is all a matter of what theory you use to explain how they form\/evolve. use sm, its already done, use false protoplanetary disk theory, you'll be searching for a while longer."},{"MAG_ID":2119933464,"tags":"Q1136838","hr_tags":"som","label":8,"problem":"the learner follow-up in problem solving is a hard issue. it is more difficult when there are a lot of learners or

reduces effective permeability. in this study, the lithologic facies is classified into three classes having different characteristics of effective permeability, depending on the shapes of mudstones. the reservoir modelling workflow of this study consists of two main modules; facies modelling and permeability modelling. the facies modelling provides an identification of the three lithologic facies, using a stochastic approach, which mainly control the effective permeability. the permeability modelling populates mudstone volume fraction first, then transforms it into effective permeability. a series of flow simulations applied to mini-models of the lithologic facies obtains the transformation functions of the mudstone volume fraction into the effective permeability. seismic data contribute to the facies modelling via providing prior probability of facies, which is incorporated in the facies models by geostatistical techniques. in particular, this study employs a
