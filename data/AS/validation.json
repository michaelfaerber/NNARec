experiments are presented that examine the learning trajectory of a simple recurrent network exposed to musical input. both experiments compare the networks internal representations to behavioral data: listeners rate the networks own novel musical output from different points along the learning trajectory. the first study focused on learning the tonal relationships inherent in five simple melodies. the developmental trajectory of the network was studied by examining sparseness of the hidden layer activations and the sophistication of the networks compositions. the second study used more complex musical input and focused on both tonal and rhythmic relationships in music. we found that increasing sparseness of the hidden layer activations strongly correlated with the increasing sophistication of the networks output. interestingly, sparseness was not programmed into the network; this property simply arose from learning the musical input. we argue that sparseness underlies the networks success: it is the mechanism through which musical characteristics are learned and distilled, and facilitates the networks ability to produce more complex and stylistic novel compositions

hall ithaca, ny  usa abstract it is proposed that learning a language  is formally equivalent to reconstructing the state-space of a non-linear dynamical system. given this, a set of results from the study of nonlinear dynamical systems may be especially relevant for an understanding of the mechanisms underlying language processing. these results demonstrate that a dynamical system can be reconstructed on the basis of the data that it emits. they imply that with minimal assumptions the structure of an arbitrary language can be inferred entirely from a corpus of data. state-space reconstruction can implemented in a straightforward manner in a model neural system. simulations of a , trained on a large corpus of natural language, are described. results imply that the network sucessfully recognizes temporal patterns in this corpus. introduction complex pattern recognition is often characterized by means of a simple geometric analogy. any object or pattern may be described as a single point in a highdimensional space. for example, a square grayscale image that is  pixels in length, may be described as a point in the   dimensional space of all possible images. a collection of such images is a set of points in this space. if these patterns are not entirely random, this set will reside in a subspace of lower dimensionality. to learn the structure of these images, an organism or machine must discover a compact parametric representation of this subspace. this might take the form of, for example, finding a reasonably small set of basis vectors that will span the subspace and projecting each image onto these vectors. having done this, each image can be classified in terms of a new and more meaningful coordinate system. you effectively describe what is there in terms of what is known. this geometric approach is routinely employed in the study of visual object recognition, but may easily be extended to a wide range of categorization and classification tasks. in almost all cases, however, the patterns under study have been multi-dimensional static patterns. in contrast, the study of temporal pattern recogntion using this or related approaches has not been welldeveloped. for example, one of the most widely employed techniques for temporal pattern recognition, hidden markov models are limited in their generality due to their fundamental inability to handle patterns above a certain complexity. this absence of general models for temporal pattern recognition is evident in the study of human language processing, which

whether exploiting the reservoir is feasible or not, how much hydrocarbon can be extracted from it and whether the geology of the reservoir will stand the stresses of exploitation without collapsing. three properties stand-out amongst all the rest, as they are closely correlated to the amount of hydrocarbon present in the reservoir and also to the feasibility of its exploitation: permeability, porosity, and lithology. obtaining reliable and robust measurements of these properties requires extracting core samples from the reservoir, which is, however, a very resource-consuming task. hence, it is common to use other tools  to extract several other properties from the reservoir, in an attempt to obtain information that might help experts to estimate these properties on those intervals at
